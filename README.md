# BikeStoreProject CRUD Operations Java + Spring + Hibernate + PostMan

# Spring Crud Operations + Front End Simulator : PostMan

In this project you can make CRUD operations with Spring ,on each bike or bikeAccesories , using the front-end simulator PostMan at : //localhost:8080

It is directly conected with data base MySQL from where you can bring something from data base , create , delete , update directly from Post Man

In project I used DTO to be sure that the user receives only the information that a usual User it's allwod to recieve , and I used Mapper's to Map things 
from Entity to DTO and from DTO to Entity

I used Repository from his benefits , but the best benefit I found it's that it extends CrudRepository 
 
In the Controller I used logger.info , and here we can make all the CRUD operations simple and very clear
